## Key points

-  Browsers are used to render websites, they are meant to understand html/css
-  Html & CSS are not heavily used in the industry, JavaScript is heavily relied upon.
-  Html provides structure to the website.
-  Tags in html are used for giving structure to the html code.
-  CSS is used for styling.

## Browser is not just a SOFTWARE, it is almost a full blown Operating System.

	It has its own data stack?
	It its own UI?
