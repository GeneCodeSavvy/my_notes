# Introduction to Quantitative Biology

## What is Quantitative Biology?

Quantitative Biology involves quantification of results (example - image processing for feature extractions or statistical tests) and creating quantitative models. 

## What are the 3 criteria for a Good Model in Biological Sciences?

1. `A person who is familiar with a particular biological system writes down the quatitative model for that system. The model should be as simple it can be, but not simpler.`
2. `Incorporate correct basic physical models. The number of fundamental physical models important for constructing quantitative models in biology is fairly limited. In the Physical Biology of the Cell textbook, nine theories/models are introduced as fundamental tools to construct quantitative models in biology`
3. `Use the correct order-of-magnitude estimates for relevant parameters`
