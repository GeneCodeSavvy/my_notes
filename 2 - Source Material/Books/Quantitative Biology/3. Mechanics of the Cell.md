# Mechanics of the Cell

## Introduction

`Physical forces and mechanical properties are fundamental to structural calculations. The cytoskeleton and motor proteins are well-known sources of these physical forces within the cell. Additionally, the cytoskeleton determines the cell's mechanical properties. While biophysics has advanced our understanding of the mechanical properties and force production of cellular materials in vitro, accurately measuring these aspects in vivo remains challenging. Consequently, structural calculations, or quantitative modeling, often involve a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. Currently we gather indirect evidences to understand cell mechanics, this is generally a interdiscipinary approach including biophysics and cell biology`

`Cell architecture is dynamic, with the positions and configurations of components constantly changing.`

## Methods for Applying Forces to Cellular Materials 

1.  **AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy)** is generally used to scan the surfaces at an atomic level. It can also used to measure the repulsive forces generated when the tip of the cantilever probe is pushed into the surface with an arbitrary force. 
2. **Laser Irradiation** is used to generate localised heat at focused positions, where the cell structures are destroyed at a specific location. Studying the movements of objects after irradiation, can enable us to estimate the tension before the irradiation. 
3. **By confining cells within microstructures**, the structure walls exert force on the cells. For cells that do not attach to a substrate, such as those in an embryo, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) resin molds are used. In contrast, for substrate-attaching cells like HeLa cells, their shape can be controlled by printing the molecules they interact with into specific shapes.
