# Cell Architectonics
## What is Cell Architectonics?

Cell Architectonics studies the construction of Cellular structures from macromolecules (gene products). It aims to understand how the spatial organisation of a cell is achieved. It can be classified as the sub-field of Cell biology. 

The four main objectives are the understanding of :
1. Mechanics
2. Diversity
3. Self Organization
4. Time dependant development of the Cell
