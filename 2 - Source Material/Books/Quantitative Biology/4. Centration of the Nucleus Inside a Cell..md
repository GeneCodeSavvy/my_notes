# Centration of the Nucleus Inside a Cell.

## Models for centration of the nucleus 
1. Pushing model 
2. Cytoplasmic pulling model
3. Cortex pulling model

## Constructing a two-dimensional model for the cell 

Let the Length of the cell be 2L, the position of nucleus be x, and the number of microtubules each side be N

## Modeling Forces to move the nucleus. 

The Reynolds number for movements inside a cell (*C. elegans*) is very low, thus is viscous dominant. 

Movements of spherical objects (*nucleus*) in a viscous fluid can be described by the Stokes Law :  
$F=6\pi\eta Rv$, where $\eta$ stands for dynamic viscosity, R stands for radius of the object, v stands for the velocity, and F stands for the viscous drag.   

## Force generated in the cytoplasmic pulling model
