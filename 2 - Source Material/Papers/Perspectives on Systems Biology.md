# Perspectives on Systems Biology

## Abstract
`as the moment arises, major importance needs to be placed on the establishment of methodologies and techniques that enable us to understand biological systems as systems`

The author aims to integrate the understanding of individual components within biological systems, a knowledge base developed through advancements in molecular biology. Emphasising the importance of these advancements, the author advocates for a standardised approach to studying biological systems as unified wholes.


## Introduction 
`Systems biology is a new field of biology that aims at a system-level understanding of biological systems. If we are to understand biological systems as systems, we must understand (1) the structures of the systems (both components and their structural relationships), (2) behaviors and their characteristics at different points in the parameter space, (3) methods controlling the states and behaviors of the system, and (4) methods by which systems with desired functions are designed and built.`


## Characteristics of Biological Systems 
`Biological systems are best charecterised by the following three structural charecteristics: 
1. `Heterogeneity of components`
2. `Complexity of components`
3. `Selectivity of interactions``


## Design Patterns and Control Principles 
`As it can be assumed from the fact that the structures of biological systems are formed through evolution -- that is, through the accumulation of the effects of random events with selection pressure -- there is no guarantee that existing biological systems are optimally designed for the various functions they exhibit. Thus, it is not possible to infer the structure of a system from the function of the system. Instead of pursuing design principles that dictate how a system shall be optimally designed for the desired function, we should try to identify patterns of design so that we can create a library of design patterns that are used in biological systems and develop methods that can quickly identify which of these patterns is used for a specific biological system.`

`In engineering systems, robustness and stability are achieved by the use of feedback, redundancy, and modular design.`

Therefore, **feedback, redundancy, and modular design** are prevalent design patterns in biological systems, which primarily aim to achieve **robustness and stability**.


## System Structure Identification 

`The difficulty is that the structure of such a network cannot necessarily be inferred from experimental data based on some principles or universal rules because biological systems evolved through a stochastic process.`

### A Choice from Multiple Solutions 

`Even if two phenotypically similar patterns are formed, there is no guarantee that they are formed by the same mechanisms. We should consider that biological systems exploit all possible mechanisms that can support desired functions. This means that there may be several different mechanisms that can create similar phenotypes.`

### Approaches for Structure Identification 

`Several attempts have already been made to identify gene regulatory network from experimental data. These attempts have taken the following approaches:
1. `Bottom-Up Approach`
2. `Top-Down Approach`
3. `Hybrid Approach`

### Computational Challenges

`Given a set of noisy expression profiles, experimental data, and partially correct networks, find a set of plausible gene regulatory network topologies and their associated parameters.`

### Measurement Issues 

`Computational efforts alone will never identify the structure of gene and metabolic networks. There are numbers of aspects of the measurement technique that need to be improved.
1. `Accuracy of DNA micro-array techniques or Efficiency of RT-PCR.`
2. `Need of Single cell measurement techniques.
3. `Along with mRNA levels, protein concentration and the intracellular localization patterns should also be considered.`
