## HTML heading elements (< h1> to < h6>) are used to define headings on a web page. They establish a hierarchical structure for content, with `<h1>` representing the most important heading and `<h6>` the least important.

Key Characteristics:
1. Font size: There is a descending font size hierarchy, with `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` the smallest.
2. Bold text: Heading text is typically rendered in bold by default.
3. Spacing: Headings are generally given more vertical space above and below them compared to regular text.
