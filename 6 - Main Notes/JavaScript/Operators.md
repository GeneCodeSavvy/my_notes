JavaScript has both _binary_ and _unary_ operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:

```
operand1 operator operand2
```

There are following types of operators in JS:

1. [Assignment operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#assignment_operators)
2. [Comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#comparison_operators)
3. [Arithmetic operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#arithmetic_operators)
4. [Bitwise operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#bitwise_operators)
5. [Logical operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#logical_operators)
6. [BigInt operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#bigint_operators)
7. [String operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#string_operators)
8. [Conditional (ternary) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#conditional_ternary_operator)
9. [Comma operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#comma_operator)
10. [Unary operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators#unary_operators)
