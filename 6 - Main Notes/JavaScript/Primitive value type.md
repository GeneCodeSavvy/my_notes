Tags: [[Datatypes]]

Primitive datatypes contain 7 types of values 
1. Numbers : Floating point numbers => Used for decimals and integers
2. String : Sequence of characters => Used for text 
3. Boolean : Logical type that can only be true or false => Used for making decisions 
4. Undefined : Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value')
5. Null : Also means no value. But both are used in different contexts.
6. Symbol (ES2015) : Values that is unique and cannot be changed. (Not useful for now).
7. BigInt (2020) : Larger number types than the Number type can hold.
