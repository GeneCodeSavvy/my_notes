An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (`=`), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, `x = f()` is an assignment expression that assigns the value of `f()` to `x`.

There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand for the operations listed in the following table:

Types of Assignment Operators:
1. Assignment `x = f()`
2. Addition assignment `x += f()`
3. Subtraction assignment `x -= f()`
4. Multiplication assignment `x *= f()`
5. Division assignment `x /= f()`
6. Remainder assignment `x %= f()`
7. Exponential assignment `x **= f()`
8. Left Shift assignment `x <<= f()`
9. Right Shift assignment `x >>= f()`
10. Unsigned Right Shift assignment `x >>>= f()` 
11. Bitwise AND assignment `x &= f()`
12. Bitwise OR assignment `x |= f()`
13. Bitwise XOR assignment `x ^= f()`
14. Logical AND assignment `x &&= f()`
15. Logical OR assignment `x ||= f()`
16. Nullish coalescing assignment `x ??= f()`
