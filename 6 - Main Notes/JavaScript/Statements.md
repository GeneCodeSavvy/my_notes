**Statements** are the instructions that tell the browser what actions to perform. A statement can be as simple as assigning a value to a variable, or more complex, like controlling the flow of code with conditions and loops. Statements are the fundamental building blocks of a JavaScript program, and they define the behaviour and structure of the code.

Each statement generally ends with a semicolon (`;`), although itâ€™s not always required. JavaScript programs are composed of many statements, executed one after another in a sequence unless control flow changes it. You can combine these different types of statements to build complex logic and functionality in your applications.

## These statements fall into different categories based on their purpose:

1. **Control Flow Statements**: Manage the flow of execution (e.g., `if...else`, `switch`, `while`, `for`).
2. **Declaration Statements**: Declare variables, constants, functions, or classes (e.g., `var`, `let`, `const`, `function`, `class`).
3. **Expression Statements**: Perform assignments or calls (e.g., `x = 5;`, `console.log(x);`).
4. **Exception Handling Statements**: Handle errors (e.g., `try...catch`, `throw`).
5. **Module Statements**: Import and export code from other modules (e.g., `import`, `export`).
6. **Looping Statements**: Repeat code blocks (e.g., `for`, `while`, `do...while`).
7. **Jump Statements**: Control the flow of loops or code blocks (e.g., `break`, `continue`, `return`).
8. **Debugging Statements**: Used for debugging (e.g., `debugger`).
9. **Other Specialized Statements**: Like `with`, `label`, `async`, `await`.
