Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated. By default, JavaScript code runs sequentially from the first line to the last. However, control flow statements allow developers to manipulate this order based on conditions, loops, and other logic, providing flexibility and making the code more dynamic.

Control flow statements enable your code to make decisions, repeat actions, or even jump to specific points within the code. This is essential for building interactive applications and handling complex logic.

## List of Control Flow Statements:

1. **Conditional Statements:**
   - `if`
   - `else if`
   - `else`
   - `switch`

2. **Looping Statements:**
   - `for`
   - `while`
   - `do...while`
   - `for...in`
   - `for...of`

3. **Jump Statements:**
   - `break`
   - `continue`

4. **Exception Handling Statements:**
   - `try`
   - `catch`
   - `finally`
   - `throw`
