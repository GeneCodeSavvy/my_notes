## Question 

Given an integer n. You need to recreate the pattern given below for any value of N. Let's say for N = 5, the pattern should look like as below:

```markdown
A

BB

CCC

DDDD

EEEEE
```

## Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
class Solution {
    pattern16(n) {
        let unicodeValue = 65;
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            const string = String.fromCharCode(unicodeValue);
            for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                process.stdout.write(string)
            }
            unicodeValue++
            console.log()
        }
    }
}
```

## Summary of Approach

This solution uses nested loops to generate a triangle pattern of repeated alphabets. The outer loop iterates through rows and manages the current letter, while the inner loop prints the same letter multiple times in each row. It utilizes Unicode values starting from 65 (which represents 'A') and increments this value for each new row. The `String.fromCharCode()` method converts Unicode values to characters, creating a pattern where each row repeats a new letter one more time than the previous row.

## Pseudo Code

```pseudo
Initialize unicodeValue to 65 (Unicode for 'A')
For each row from 0 to n-1:
    Convert unicodeValue to character
    For each column from 0 to current row number:
        Print the character
    Increment unicodeValue
    Move to next line
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the input number. The nested loops result in a total of n(n+1)/2 iterations.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.

## Edge Cases Considered

- The solution handles the case when n = 1, printing just "A".
- It correctly handles all positive integer inputs for n.
- The solution will work correctly for n up to 26 (which is the number of letters in the English alphabet).

## Optimization Potential

The current solution is well-optimized for its purpose. However, potential improvements could include:
1. For very large inputs, using string concatenation or string repetition (`string.repeat(count)`) instead of multiple `process.stdout.write()` calls.
2. If the pattern needs to be reused, pre-calculating the strings for each row and storing them.

## Visualization Aid

Here's a visual representation of how the pattern evolves for n = 5:

```
A
BB
CCC
DDDD
EEEEE
```

Each line represents one iteration of the outer loop, showing:
- Each row contains a single letter repeated
- The number of repetitions in each row increases by 1
- Each new row uses the next letter of the alphabet
- The pattern forms a right-angled triangle of repeated alphabets
```
