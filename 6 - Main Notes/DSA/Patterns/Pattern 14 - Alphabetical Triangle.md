## Question 

Given an integer n. You need to recreate the pattern given below for any value of N. Let's say for N = 5, the pattern should look like as below:
  
```markdown
A
AB
ABC
ABCD
ABCDE
```

## Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
class Solution {
    pattern14(n) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            let unicodeValue = 65;
            for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                const string = String.fromCharCode(unicodeValue);
                process.stdout.write(string)
                unicodeValue++
            }
            console.log()
        }
    }
}
```

## Summary of Approach

This solution uses nested loops to generate a triangle pattern of alphabets. The outer loop iterates through rows, while the inner loop prints characters in each row. It utilizes Unicode values starting from 65 (which represents 'A') and increments this value to print subsequent letters. The `String.fromCharCode()` method is used to convert Unicode values to their corresponding characters, creating a pattern where each row contains one more letter than the previous.

## Pseudo Code

```pseudo
For each row from 0 to n-1:
    Initialize unicodeValue to 65 (Unicode for 'A')
    For each column from 0 to current row number:
        Convert unicodeValue to character
        Print the character
        Increment unicodeValue
    Move to next line
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the input number. The nested loops result in a total of n(n+1)/2 iterations.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.

## Edge Cases Considered

- The solution handles the case when n = 1, printing just "A".
- It correctly handles all positive integer inputs for n.
- The solution will work correctly for n up to 26 (which is the number of letters in the English alphabet).

## Optimization Potential

The current solution is well-optimized for its purpose. However, potential improvements could include:
1. Pre-calculating the strings for each row and storing them, if the pattern is to be reused multiple times.
2. For very large inputs, using string concatenation instead of multiple `process.stdout.write()` calls.

## Visualization Aid

Here's a visual representation of how the pattern evolves for n = 5:

```
A
AB
ABC
ABCD
ABCDE
```

Each line represents one iteration of the outer loop, showing:
- The number of letters in each row increases by 1
- Letters restart from 'A' in each new row
- The pattern forms a right-angled triangle of alphabets
